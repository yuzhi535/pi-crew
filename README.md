**Coordinate AI agent teams inside [Pi](https://github.com/nicekate/pi-coding-agent).**

pi-crew is a Pi extension that orchestrates autonomous multi-agent workflows — research, implementation, review, testing, and more — with durable state, parallel execution, worktree isolation, and safe defaults.

```text
npm: pi-crew
repo: https://github.com/baphuongna/pi-crew
```



## Features

- **Workflow topology advisory** (v0.9.15) — before each run, pi-crew classifies the workflow's shape (`single` / `sequential` / `concurrent` / `complex-dag`) and prints an **advisory note** with measured cost evidence (e.g. "3-step sequential: measured 5.7× slower than 3 raw Agent calls — proceeding anyway"). Never blocks — the agent decides. Tool description and prompt-snippet carry the same guidance up-front, so agents know the trade-off before calling. New files: `src/workflows/topology-analyzer.ts`, `src/workflows/preflight-validator.ts`. See [Workflow topology advisory](#workflow-topology-advisory) below.
- **One Pi tool** — `team` handles routing, planning, execution, review, and cleanup
- **Autonomous delegation** — policy injection decides when/how to delegate based on task complexity
- **needs_attention status** — tasks that complete without calling `submit_result` get `needs_attention` (terminal) instead of `completed`; allows retry/re-run without blocking downstream phases
- **Real child Pi workers** — each task spawns a separate Pi process by default; scaffold/dry-run opt-out
- **Adaptive planning** — implementation workflow lets a planner agent decide subagent fanout
- **Parallel execution** — tasks in the same phase run concurrently with configurable concurrency
- **Durable state** — manifest, tasks, events, artifacts all persisted to disk
- **Async/background runs** — detached runs survive session switches with completion notifications
- **Worktree isolation** — opt-in git worktrees per task for safe parallel edits
- **Rich UI** — live widget, dashboard, progress tracking, model/token display
- **Observability** — metrics registry, Prometheus/OTLP exporters, heartbeat watching, deadletter queue
- **Resource management** — create/update/delete agents, teams, workflows with validation
- **Import/export** — portable run bundles for sharing and archiving
- **Adaptive plan fanout** — single `assess` step lets a planner pick the smallest effective crew
- **Adaptive workflows** — `implementation`, `review`, `parallel-research`, `research` workflows ship in `workflows/`
- **Hardened secrets** — linear-time detection covers PEM keys, Authorization headers, Bearer tokens, and `key=value` patterns
- **Scheduled runs** — `schedule`/`scheduled` actions with cron, interval, and one-shot support; spawned runs tracked and auto-cancelled on job removal
- **Plugin system** — framework-aware context injection (Next.js, Vite, Vitest) via plugin registry
- **Health scoring** — penalty-based run health with time-series snapshots
- **Autonomous goal loops** (P0/P1) — `team action='goal'` runs an autonomous multi-turn loop: a worker does a turn, a separate LLM judge evaluates the transcript+evidence against the goal, and on "not-achieved" the reason is fed into the next turn's prompt. Stops on achieved / maxTurns / budget / blocked. Claude-Code-style `/goal`. See `docs/goals.md`.
- **Dynamic workflows** (P2/P3) — author orchestration as a `.dwf.ts` script (JS loops/branch/cross-review) instead of a static step list. The script runs in the background, calls subagents via `ctx.agent()`/`ctx.fanOut()`, holds intermediate results in JS variables, and only `ctx.setResult()` reaches the main context. `ctx.phase()` marks logical phases; **round-14** adds `ctx.log()` (durable `dwf.log` events), `ctx.budget` (per-workflow token budget that auto-rejects `ctx.agent()` when exhausted), and `ctx.args<T>()` (typed workflow arguments). TypeScript IntelliSense is available via `import type { WorkflowCtx } from "pi-crew/workflow"`. `workflow-create`/`-delete`/`-save` require `confirm:true` at the tool-call layer (the only gate — a malicious agent that passes `confirm:true` programmatically bypasses it; this is postinstall-equivalent trust, not a human-in-the-loop dialog). See `docs/dynamic-workflows.md`.
- **Strict SKILL.md validation** (L3, v0.9.8) — skills with malformed frontmatter (missing/malformed `name`/`description`, type mismatches) now **fail-fast at discovery** with visible diagnostics, instead of silently producing broken behavior at runtime. HYBRID policy: HARD on required fields, SOFT (warn) on unknown props for forward-compat. Surfaced via `buildSkillValidationDiagnostics()`.
- **Durable event replay** (L1, v0.9.8) — `RunEventBus.onWithReplay()` catches up a re-subscribing dashboard/overlay with events it missed during transient absence (toggle, reconnect), replaying from the durable JSONL log with seq-based dedup. No information loss even if the live subscriber was briefly gone.
- **Lossless-by-default output handling** (L4, v0.9.8) — worker output thresholds sized from measured data (100% of real outputs fit without compaction); when compaction is unavoidable it keeps head+tail (preserves closing code fences/headings) instead of head-only truncation. No more `[pi-crew compacted N chars]` markers eating the end of a worker's result.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-crew
```

Local development:

```bash
pi install ./pi-crew
```

Post-install config bootstrap:

```bash
pi-crew          # after npm install
node ./pi-crew/install.mjs   # from local clone
```

> **Split-scope install note (v0.8.11+):** pi installs extensions under
> `~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/<ext>/`, separate from pi's own
> node_modules tree (nvm / `%APPDATA%\npm` / Volta / fnm). Since v0.8.11
> pi-crew resolves the `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` peer dep robustly
> across these layouts — no symlink/NODE_PATH workaround needed. If you ever
> do hit `Cannot find module '@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent'`, set
> `PI_CREW_PEER_DEP_DIR=<path to the pi-coding-agent package dir>` as a
> one-line workaround (or install pi-crew in pi's own scope:
> `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-crew`).

### Uninstall

`pi uninstall npm:pi-crew` removes the package, but pi doesn't fire an
extension uninstall hook, so several things pi-crew created are left behind.
Reverse them explicitly with `team action=cleanup`. There are **two scopes**:

> **v0.8.14+**: `team action=init` **no longer injects a guidance block into
> AGENTS.md** (it was redundant — the `team` tool self-describes via its tool
> registration, so the agent learns pi-crew's commands from there, not AGENTS.md).
> The cleanup steps below still work for removing blocks injected by **older
> versions** (<0.8.14).

#### Project scope (reverse `team action=init`)

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Preview what would be removed, without writing:
team action=cleanup dryRun=true

# 2. Remove the AGENTS.md guidance block only (.crew/ preserved):
team action=cleanup

# 3. Remove BOTH the guidance block AND the .crew/ state directory (force):
team action=cleanup force=true
```

The guidance block is wrapped in `<!-- PI-CREW:GUIDANCE:START -->` /
`<!-- PI-CREW:GUIDANCE:END -->` markers, so cleanup removes **only** that
block — your own AGENTS.md content is never touched. The `.crew/` directory
is removed **only** with `force=true` (it's irreversible).

#### User scope (remove user-level state `pi uninstall` leaves behind)

```bash
# 4. Preview + remove pi-crew user-scope junk:
team action=cleanup scope=user dryRun=true   # preview
team action=cleanup scope=user               # remove ~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-crew/
                                              #   + pi-crew smoke-test *.bak files

# 5. (Optional) Also remove the global config (holds your settings):
team action=cleanup scope=user force=true    # also removes ~/.pi/agent/pi-crew.json
```

This removes the pi-crew state dir (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-crew/`, which
holds run artifacts + state), the global config (with `force=true`), and the
`*.md.bak-<timestamp>` smoke-test backup files pi-crew's own tests may leave in
`~/.pi/agent/agents/`. **Your authored agent files (`*.md`) are never touched**
— pi-crew can't tell which were user-created vs test-copied, so only the
clearly-pi-crew `.bak-*` backups are removed.

#### Final step

```bash
# 6. Remove the package itself:
pi uninstall npm:pi-crew
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize project

```text
/team-init
```

### 2. Run a team

```text
/team-run Investigate failing tests and propose a fix
```

Or via tool call:

```json
{
  "action": "run",
  "team": "default",
  "goal": "Investigate failing tests and propose a fix"
}
```

### 3. Check status

```text
/team-status <runId>
/team-dashboard
```

### 4. Get a recommendation

When unsure which team/workflow fits:

```json
{
  "action": "recommend",
  "goal": "Refactor auth flow and add tests"
}
```

## Builtin Teams

| Team | Workflow | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|
| `default` | explore → plan → execute → verify | Balanced, general-purpose |
| `fast-fix` | explore → execute → verify | Quick bug fixes |
| `implementation` | Adaptive planner decides fanout | Multi-file implementation |
| `review` | explore → code-review → security-review → verify | Code review + security audit |
| `research` | explore → analyze → write | Research and documentation |
| `parallel-research` | Parallel shards → synthesize → write | Multi-source research |

---

## Workflow topology advisory

Before every `team action='run'`, pi-crew classifies the workflow shape and prints an informational note. **It never blocks** — agents decide whether to proceed, refactor, or override.

### How it works

```text
team action='run', workflow='fast-fix', goal='...'
  ↓
pi-crew analyzes topology: 3-step sequential
  ↓
⚠️  [team-tool.preflight] WARN: 3-step sequential chain: measured 5.7× slower
    and 1.9× costlier than 3 raw Agent calls (Run #3 in .crew/state/runs/).
    Proceeding anyway.
  ↓
Workflow runs to completion. Agent sees the note, decides for next time.
```

### Topology → advisory level

| Topology | When | Level | What pi-crew prints |
|---|---|---|---|
| `single` | 1 step, no concurrency | `warn` | "raw Agent tool would be ~30× faster and ~5× cheaper. Proceeding anyway." |
| `sequential` (2-3 steps) | Linear chain, no fan-out | `warn` | "measured 5.7× slower than raw Agent calls. Proceeding anyway." |
| `sequential` (4+ steps) | Linear chain, longer | `warn` | "audit trail may justify pi-crew overhead. Proceeding anyway." |
| `concurrent` | ≥3 truly parallel agents (parallelGroup) | `note` | "✅ Validated use case: N-way parallel fan-out. pi-crew's parallelism wins." |
| `complex-dag` | 4+ steps with data dependencies | `note` | "✅ Validated use case: complex DAG with adaptive plan." |
| `dynamic` | `.dwf.ts` script | `info` | "Runtime decides topology." |

### When to prefer raw `Agent` over `team`

Use the raw `Agent` tool when:
- You have a single task or quick question (1-step)
- You have 2–3 sequential independent steps (no DAG branching, no concurrency)

Use `team` when:
- You have ≥3 agents running TRULY CONCURRENTLY (`parallelGroup`)
- You have a COMPLEX DAG (4+ steps with data dependencies, branching)
- You need an audit trail, team coordination, or worktree isolation that justifies pi-crew's overhead

### How agents learn the rule

The guidance is available in three places agents see:

1. **`team` tool description** — the LLM reads this when considering whether to call the tool. Includes an explicit "ℹ️ ADVISORY NOTE (preflight, never blocks)" section.
2. **`team` prompt snippet** — rendered in agent context when the tool is relevant. Single-line summary of the rule.
3. **`.crew/knowledge.md` CONVENTIONS section** — always injected into every worker session's context. Contains the full 4-question self-check.

### How to silence the advisory

The advisory is **informational only** — there is no `force:true` flag needed (the run proceeds regardless). If you want to silence the `console.warn` output for cleaner logs, set `PI_CREW_QUIET_PREFLIGHT=1` in your environment.

### Implementation

- `src/workflows/topology-analyzer.ts` — pure classifier (parses workflow YAML, builds DAG, detects parallelGroups)
- `src/workflows/preflight-validator.ts` — returns `{level: info|note|warn, message, suggestion}` (never throws)
- Integration: `src/extension/team-tool/run.ts` (extension layer, prints advisory) + `src/runtime/team-runner.ts` (defense-in-depth, also logs)

### Tests

- `test/unit/topology-analyzer.test.ts` — 13 cases (each topology + edge cases)
- `test/unit/preflight-validator.test.ts` — 11 cases (each level + advisory contract)

## Runtime Modes

pi-crew supports multiple runtime modes for task execution:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` (default) | Uses `child-process` unless overridden by config |
| `child-process` | Spawns real `pi` child processes — each task runs in isolation |
| `scaffold` | Dry-run mode — renders prompts and persists artifacts without executing |
| `live-session` (experimental) | In-process session execution within the parent Pi |

```json
// Use scaffold mode (no real workers, just prompts)
{ "action": "run", "team": "default", "goal": "...", "runtime": { "mode": "scaffold" } }

// Disable workers globally
{ "executeWorkers": false }
```

## Async Runs

Async runs are **detached** from the session — they survive session switches and reloads. Pi-crew notifies when complete.

```json
{ "action": "run", "team": "default", "goal": "...", "async": true }
```

```text
/team-run --async Investigate failing tests
```

Background runs use `node --import jiti-register.mjs` for TypeScript support. See [docs/runtime-flow.md](docs/runtime-flow.md) for details.

## Worktree Isolation

Worktree mode creates an **isolated git worktree per task** — safe for parallel edits to the same branch.

```json
{
  "action": "run",
  "team": "implementation",
  "goal": "Refactor auth",
  "workspaceMode": "worktree"
}
```

```text
/team-run --worktree Refactor auth
```

Requirements:
- Git repository (cwd must be inside a git repo)
- Clean working tree (no uncommitted changes in the leader worktree)
  - Can be disabled via config: `requireCleanWorktreeLeader: false`
- Worktrees auto-cleanup on run completion/cancel

If preconditions are not met, a friendly error message is returned instead of crashing.

## Configuration

### Config Paths

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| User (primary) | `~/.pi/agent/pi-crew.json` |
| User (legacy, still read for migration) | `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-crew/config.json` |
| Project (crewRoot) | `.crew/config.json` (or `.pi/teams/config.json` legacy) |
| Project (alt) | `.pi/pi-crew.json` |

### Quick Config

```text
/team-config                           # view all settings
/team-config runtime.mode=scaffold    # set a key (--project for project scope)
/team-config --unset=runtime.mode     # reset a key to default
/team-config --project runtime.mode   # project-scoped view
/team-settings path                   # show config file path
```

### Key Settings

| Section | Keys | Default |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Runtime** | `mode`: `auto` \| `child-process` \| `scaffold` \| `live-session` | `auto` |
| | `maxTurns`, `graceTurns`, `groupJoin`, `requirePlanApproval` | various |
| **Concurrency** | `limits.maxConcurrentWorkers` | workflow-dependent |
| | `limits.maxTaskDepth`, `limits.maxChildrenPerTask` | 2, 5 |
| **Async** | `asyncByDefault` | `false` |
| | `runtime.groupJoin`: `off` \| `group` \| `smart` | `smart` |
| **Autonomy** | `profile`: `manual` \| `suggested` \| `assisted` \| `aggressive` | `suggested` |
| | `autonomous.injectPolicy`, `preferAsyncForLongTasks` | true, false |
| **UI** | `widgetPlacement`, `dashboardPlacement` | compact widget |
| | `showModel`, `showTokens` | display controls |
| **Reliability** | `autoRetry`, `autoRecover`, `deadletterThreshold` | opt-in |
| **Observability** | `observability.enabled`, `observability.pollIntervalMs`, `otlp.enabled`/`otlp.endpoint` | opt-in |
| **Worktree** | `worktree.setupHook`, `worktree.linkNodeModules`, `worktree.seedPaths` (mode is set via `workspaceMode: "worktree"` at run time) | disabled by default |

> ⚠️ **Trust boundary**: project config cannot override sensitive execution controls (workers, runtime mode, autonomy, agent overrides). Set those in **user config** only.

## Reliability & Trust

### Compaction resilience

pi-crew survives Pi's context compaction. When the context is compacted (auto or manual), in-flight crew runs are detected and a **resume directive** is injected into the post-compaction context, so tasks continue instead of stalling. You'll see a notification like:

```
Context compacted. 1 pi-crew run(s) still in-flight — use team status to continue.
```

**Durable event replay** (v0.9.8, L1): even if a dashboard/overlay is briefly gone during compaction or a reconnect, `RunEventBus.onWithReplay()` catches it up with the events it missed, replaying from the durable JSONL log with seq-based dedup — no information loss. (The dashboard wires this up per-run; the primitive is available for any subscriber.)

**Lossless-by-default worker output** (v0.9.8, L4): output-handling thresholds are sized from measured real data (100% of real worker outputs fit without any compaction). When compaction *is* unavoidable, it keeps head+tail instead of head-only truncation, so closing code fences and headings survive — no more `[pi-crew compacted N chars]` markers eating the end of a result.

### Plan-level human-in-the-loop (HITL)

Set `runtime.requirePlanApproval = true` to gate **any workflow** at the plan→execute boundary. After the read-only (planning) phases complete, the run pauses for explicit approval before mutating tasks run:

```
team api op=approve-plan runId=<runId>   # approve → execute
  team api op=cancel-plan runId=<runId>    # cancel
```

This is plan-level (not per-step) — per-step gates would kill the parallelism that's pi-crew's point.

### Cross-run memory (`.crew/knowledge.md`)

Create `.crew/knowledge.md` in your project root with durable learnings (code style, test commands, common pitfalls, past refactors). It's auto-read (up to 16KB) and injected into **every** agent's system prompt — the main session and each crew worker. pi-crew gets better the longer you use it.

```markdown
# Project Knowledge
- Tests: run with `npm test` (not jest directly)
- Style: tabs, not spaces
- Auth refactor (2026-06): split auth.ts into session.ts + api.ts
```

### Cost visibility

Every `team summary <runId>` includes a per-role cost report:

```
═══ Cost Report ═══
Tokens: 134k (in 112k, out 5.7k, cache-write 16k)
Cost: $0.7700 across 18 turn(s)
By role:
  executor (2 tasks): $0.6100 — 79%, 98k tok, 13 turns
  reviewer (1 task): $0.1100 — 14%, 23k tok, 3 turns
```

### Single-agent mode (cliff hedge)

Any workflow can run single-agent instead of multi-agent — composing all phases into one sequential prompt:

```
team plan team=default workflow=default goal="..." singleAgent=true
```

This is pi-crew's cliff-resilient mode: the workflow definitions, phase structure, and artifact contracts survive even if a single large-context model outperforms multi-agent teams.

## Resource Discovery

Agents, teams, and workflows are discovered from three layers:

```
builtin (package)  <  user (~/.pi/agent/)  <  project (.crew/ or .pi/teams/)
```

Project resources can add new names but **cannot shadow** builtin/user resources.

### Resource Paths

| Type | Builtin | User | Project |
|------|---------|------|---------|
| Agent | `agents/*.md` | `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` | `.crew/agents/*.md` |
| Team | `teams/*.team.md` | `~/.pi/agent/teams/*.team.md` | `.crew/teams/*.team.md` |
| Workflow | `workflows/*.workflow.md` | `~/.pi/agent/workflows/*.workflow.md` | `.crew/workflows/*.workflow.md` |

### Custom Resources with Routing Metadata

## Known limitations

This is AI-developed software built for a personal workflow. These are the
sharp edges I'm aware of — there are almost certainly others I'm not.

- **Multi-step goal-wrap crashes non-deterministically.** Goal-wrapping
  multi-step builtin workflows (`fast-fix`, `default`) can hit a V8/libuv
  event-loop race that kills the background process with no signal, no core,
  and no V8 diagnostic report (8 investigation attempts: gdb, strace, perf,
  `--report-on-fatalerror`, sync-fs workarounds, worker-thread atomic writer —
  see `research-findings/goal-workflow/17-PHASE1.5-CRASH-INVESTIGATION-RFC.md`).
  **Mitigation:** multi-step workflows silently auto-downgrade to a normal
  team-run (no goal-wrap layer); single-step workflows (`implementation`)
  goal-wrap end-to-end.
- **`.dwf.ts` scripts are NOT sandboxed in v1.** The `WorkflowCtx` is
  `Object.freeze()`d, but the script runs in plain module scope with full
  `require`/`import`/`process` access (postinstall-equivalent trust).
  `isolated-vm` (real V8 isolate) is planned for a future release. Only place
  `.dwf.ts` files you have reviewed. See
  [docs/dynamic-workflows.md#security-model-important](docs/dynamic-workflows.md#security-model-important).
- **Editor/agent file caching.** After editing a loaded pi-crew source file,
  restart the Pi session for changes to take effect (jiti in-memory cache).
  Editing a `.dwf.ts` in place while a run is mid-flight can serve a stale
  module body; rename the file or restart Pi to force a fresh load.
- **Verification integrity is best-effort against adversarial workers.** The
  bookend snapshot (P1a) and git-worktree sandbox (Phase 1.5 #2, opt-in)
  raise the bar, but a worker in the same process can still tamper with files
  outside the snapshot window. Full isolation requires the planned sandbox.
- **Single maintainer + AI review.** Every change ships after 2+ consecutive
  clean static-review rounds + runtime tests, but there's no independent human
  audit. Fork and read before trusting anything that touches your data.

If you hit any of these — or a new one — please
