/**
 * Test runner wrapper that enforces non-zero exit code on failures.
 *
 * Problem: `tsx --test` always exits 0 even when tests fail.
 * Fix: Use stdio: 'inherit' so output streams directly (avoids pipe buffer
 * deadlocks on large test suites), and rely on the child's exit code.
 *
 * Always passes --test-force-exit so the child process cannot hang the
 * parent (pi) on shutdown. Defensive: prevents the "pi froze" failure
 * mode where a long-running test keeps file handles/timers open and
 * blocks the agent's wait-for-exit.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/test-runner.mjs [tsx test args...]

// concurrency causes cross-file filesystem contention that makes write-then-
// stat tests (notably state-store's createRunManifest assertions) flake:
//   - windows-latest: Windows Defender real-time scanning locks freshly-
//     created temp files → transient EPERM/EBUSY on rename inside
//     atomicWriteFile (exhausts the ~1.6s rename retries).
//   - macos-latest: /var/folders tmp contention under load → occasional
//     4ms instant write failures.
// The flake only surfaced after the Round 13/14 test additions pushed the
// runners past their timing threshold. Capping cross-file concurrency at 2
// across ALL platforms gives the FS room to flush and eliminates the storm.
// Local dev is unaffected (developers pass --test-concurrency=4 explicitly
// and run on idle machines). This only clamps the CI-requested value.
