# pi-crew Next Upgrade Roadmap

Date: 2026-05-05
Source inputs:

- `docs/research-oh-my-pi-distillation.md`
- `docs/source-runtime-refactor-map.md`
- Recent runtime hardening commits through `f5d47aa feat: surface run effectiveness evidence`

This document tracks the next practical upgrades after the current scaffold/no-op subagent fix, runtime safety classification, cancellation provenance, intent audit trail, prompt pipeline artifacts, capability inventory artifacts, and run effectiveness reporting.

## Current Baseline

Already implemented and pushed:

- Real child worker execution is the default.
- Implicit scaffold/no-op runs are blocked when worker execution is disabled by config/env.
- Explicit `runtime.mode=scaffold` remains available for dry-run prompt/artifact generation.
- Run `summary.md`, `progress.md`, and `status` now expose effectiveness evidence.
- Structured cancellation reasons flow through retry/cancel/team-runner/run events/metrics/UI snapshot.
- `cancel`, `cleanup`, `forget`, and `prune` accept audit intent metadata.
- Live-agent control distinguishes `steer` from `follow-up` at live-control/API level.
- Retry attempts have `attemptId`; max-retry deadletters link to the final `attemptId`.
- Worker prompt pipeline and capability inventory metadata artifacts are written per task.
- P0.1: effectiveness guard escalates `warn` to `blocked` for mutating-role tasks with no observable worker activity.
- P1.1: mailbox `readMailbox` accepts `kind` filter; API `read-mailbox` supports `config.kind`.
- P1.5: `TeamEventMetadata` extended with `parentEventId`, `attemptId`, `branchId`, `causationId`, `correlationId`.
- P1.6: `buildSyntheticTerminalEvidence()` produces `"worker"`/`"cancelled"` terminal records for cancelled in-flight tasks.
- P1.7: `buildCapabilityInventory(cwd)` normalizes teams/workflows/agents; API `operation=inventory`.
- P2.1: typed hook lifecycle — `registerHook`/`executeHook` registry; `before_run_start` and `before_task_start` wired.
- P2.4: `AbortSignal` wired into `collectRuns`, `validateMailbox`, `readAllMailboxMessages`, `pruneFinishedRuns`, `cleanupRunWorktrees`, etc.
- Resume scaffold runs preserve scaffold mode from original manifest when workers not disabled.

## Implementation Status as of `v0.1.46`

This roadmap is **not complete overall**. The `v0.1.46` release completed several vertical slices, but multiple roadmap items remain partial or unimplemented.

### Implemented / mostly implemented

- Baseline worker behavior: real child-process execution by default, explicit scaffold dry-runs, and blocked implicit scaffold/no-op runs.
- P0.1 ✅ effectiveness policy enforcement: default guard escalates `warn` to `blocked` for mutating-role tasks.
- P0.2 ✅ runtime safety persistence: manifests persist `runtimeResolution`; `runtime.resolved` event emitted; status shows safety; blocked runs persist evidence.
- Effectiveness reporting: summary/progress/status expose no-observed-work evidence and policy outcome.
- Structured cancellation basics: cancellation reasons flow through retry/backoff/team-runner paths and run/task events.
- Retry attempt evidence: retry attempts and max-retry deadletters carry/link `attemptId` data.
- Prompt pipeline artifacts and per-task capability metadata artifacts are written.
- P1.3 worker teardown evidence vertical slice: `WorkerExitStatus` and terminal worker cancellation evidence exist.

### Completed in this upgrade cycle (after v0.1.46)

- P0.1 effectiveness policy enforcement: default guard now escalates `warn` to `blocked` for mutating-role tasks with no observable worker activity; read-only roles remain `warning`.
- P0.2 runtime safety persistence: manifests persist `runtimeResolution`; `runtime.resolved` event emitted; status shows safety; blocked runs persist evidence.
- P1.1 durable steering/follow-up queues: `readMailbox` accepts `kind` filter; API `read-mailbox` supports `config.kind`; steering and follow-up are isolatable by kind.
- P1.2 respond vs follow-up UX: `/team-follow-up` command added for continuation prompts; `/team-respond` remains for waiting-task replies.
- P1.3 two-phase child process teardown: `WorkerExitStatus` populated from graceful SIGTERM → grace window → hard kill pipeline.
- P1.5 event-tree provenance: `TeamEventMetadata` extended with `parentEventId`, `attemptId`, `branchId`, `causationId`, `correlationId`; retry and cancel events carry `attemptId`.
- P1.6 synthetic terminal results: `buildSyntheticTerminalEvidence()` in `cancellation.ts`; cancelled in-flight tasks receive `"worker"`/`"cancelled"` terminal evidence records.
- P1.7 unified capability inventory: `buildCapabilityInventory(cwd)` normalizes teams/workflows/agents into `CapabilityItem[]`; API `operation=inventory` returns sorted JSON.
- P1.8 capability disable by stable ID: `disabledCapabilities` in `CrewPolicyConfig`; inventory marks disabled items with reason.
- P2.1 typed hook lifecycle: `HookName`, `HookMode`, `HookOutcome`, `HookContext`, `HookResult`, `HookExecutionReport` types; `registerHook`/`executeHook`/`clearHooks` registry; `before_run_start` and `before_task_start` wired into team-runner.
- P2.2 intent gates for destructive actions: `enforceDestructiveIntent` wired in cancel/cleanup/forget/prune/delete; configurable via `policy.requireIntentForDestructiveActions`.
- P2.3 durable history projection: `transformRunContextBeforeWorkerStart()` and `convertRunHistoryToWorkerPrompt()` bounded projection functions.
- P2.4 CancellationToken wired into long scans: `AbortSignal` passed to `collectRuns`/`validateMailbox`/`readAllMailboxMessages`/`pruneFinishedRuns`/`cleanupRunWorktrees`.
- P2.5 content-addressed blob store: `writeBlob`/`readBlob`/`readBlobMetadata` with SHA-256 dedup and metadata sidecars.
- P2.6 dashboard panes for capability and cancellation: `renderCapabilityPane` and `renderCancellationPane`.
- Resume scaffold run fix: preserves scaffold mode from original manifest when workers not disabled.

### Partial / not safe to mark complete

- P1.4 reserve worker control channel before spawn: controller metadata persistence during startup not yet implemented.
- P2.7 event-first UI: render coalescing and snapshot caches exist, but live UI still relies on durable file polling as a primary source in several panes.
- P2.8 shared raw scan-entry cache: not yet implemented.

### Missing / backlog

- P2.7 event-first UI — RunEventBus wired into appendEvent; UI pane subscription not yet implemented.
- P2.8 shared raw scan-entry cache — SharedScanCache implemented and wired into manifest reads; not yet wired into artifact-store or mailbox.
- P3.1 tarball-install smoke — `scripts/release-smoke.mjs` runs as manual check; not yet a CI gate.
- Hook lifecycle — `before_cancel`/`before_forget`/`before_cleanup` wired with async handlers. `task_result`/`before_publish` wired. `session_before_switch`/`run_recovery` not yet wired (need more use cases).

## Priority Legend

- **P0**: correctness/safety issue; should be addressed before next release if feasible.
- **P1**: high user-visible value or reliability gain; good patch-release candidates.
- **P2**: larger subsystem work; should be planned and sequenced.
- **P3**: polish/UX/longer-term architecture.

## P0 — Prevent Ineffective Completed Runs

### P0.1 Enforce effectiveness policy for non-scaffold workers

**Problem**

`summary/status` now surface effectiveness evidence, but non-scaffold `child-process`/`live-session` runs can still end `completed` when task evidence is weak unless the existing mutation guard fires.

**Target behavior**

- For real workers, a run with completed tasks but no observable worker activity should be `blocked` or `failed`, not silently `completed`.
- Keep explicit scaffold dry-runs allowed, but label them as dry-runs.
- Policy should be configurable:
  - `runtime.effectivenessGuard = "off" | "warn" | "block" | "fail"`
  - default candidate: `warn` for read-only roles, `block` for mutating roles.

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/team-runner.ts`
- `src/runtime/completion-guard.ts`
- `src/state/types.ts` if storing guard result on manifest/tasks
- `src/schema/config-schema.ts`
- `src/config/config.ts`
- `test/unit/summary.test.ts`
- `test/unit/team-runner-merge.test.ts` or new `test/unit/effectiveness-guard.test.ts`

**Implementation sketch**

1. Extract run effectiveness calculation into a reusable exported helper, e.g.:

   ```ts
   export interface RunEffectivenessSummary {
     completed: number;
     observable: number;
     noObservedWorkTaskIds: string[];
     needsAttentionTaskIds: string[];
     workerExecution: "enabled" | "disabled/scaffold";
     severity: "ok" | "warning" | "blocked" | "failed";
   }
   ```

2. Use this helper for:
   - `progress.md`
   - `summary.md`
   - `status`
   - policy enforcement before `run.completed`.

3. For non-scaffold runs, if mutating tasks have no mutation/tool/model/transcript evidence:
   - append `policy.action` with `reason: "ineffective_worker"`;
   - set run `blocked` or `failed` depending config;
   - include task IDs in `data`.

**Acceptance criteria** ✅

- ✅ A mocked child-process run with no tool/model/transcript evidence does not report clean `completed` by default.
- ✅ Scaffold run still completes as explicit dry-run and displays `Worker execution: disabled/scaffold`.
- ✅ `status` clearly lists `noObservedWork` and `needsAttention` task IDs.
- ✅ Unit tests cover warn/block/fail modes.
- ✅ Default guard escalates `warn` to `blocked` for mutating-role tasks.

**Verification**

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
node --experimental-strip-types --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-timeout=30000 test/unit/effectiveness-guard.test.ts test/unit/summary.test.ts
npm run test:unit
```

### P0.2 Make runtime safety visible in manifest and run events

**Problem**

`runtime.safety` exists in runtime resolution, but it is not persisted as first-class run metadata. Debugging currently requires reading events or inferred artifacts.

**Target behavior**

- Manifest records resolved runtime:

  ```json
  {
    "runtimeResolution": {
      "kind": "child-process",
      "requestedMode": "auto",
      "safety": "trusted",
      "fallback": "child-process",
      "reason": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

- `run.running` or `run.blocked` event includes the same resolution.

**Suggested files**

- `src/state/types.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/run.ts`
- `src/runtime/background-runner.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/status.ts`
- `test/unit/team-run.test.ts`
- `test/unit/runtime-resolver.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅

- ✅ `status` shows `Runtime safety: trusted|explicit_dry_run|blocked`.
- ✅ Blocked disabled-worker runs persist enough evidence to explain why no subagents spawned.
- ✅ Existing manifest schema remains backward compatible.
- ✅ `runtimeResolution` persisted on manifest; `runtime.resolved` event emitted.

## P1 — Steering/Follow-up Semantics Beyond Live Control

### P1.1 Persist separate steering and follow-up queues in mailbox state

**Current state**

`follow-up-agent` exists in live-control, but durable mailbox is still generic inbox/outbox and `respond` still has waiting-task semantics.

**Target behavior**

- Mailbox messages can carry semantic kind:

  ```ts
  kind?: "message" | "steer" | "follow-up" | "response" | "group_join";
  priority?: "urgent" | "normal" | "low";
  deliveryMode?: "interrupt" | "next_turn";
  ```

- `steer-agent` appends durable steering queue entry when no live session is present.
- `follow-up-agent` appends durable follow-up queue entry, deliverable after task stop/resume.
- UI/status separates urgent steering from follow-up backlog.

**Suggested files**

- `src/state/mailbox.ts`
- `src/runtime/live-agent-control.ts`
- `src/runtime/live-agent-manager.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/api.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/respond.ts`
- `src/ui/dashboard-panes/mailbox-pane.ts`
- `test/unit/mailbox-api.test.ts`
- `test/unit/live-agent-control.test.ts`
- `test/unit/respond-tool.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅ (partially — kind filter and API done; UI pane separation remaining)

- ✅ Steering and follow-up can be inspected separately via `readMailbox` kind filter and API `config.kind`.
- ✅ Existing inbox/outbox JSONL remains readable.
- ✅ Kind filter survives process/session switch (durable mailbox).
- ☐ UI/status separates urgent steering from follow-up backlog (mailbox pane not yet updated).

### P1.2 Clarify `respond` vs `follow-up` UX

**Problem**

`respond` is currently a waiting-task resume primitive. Users may expect it to send a general follow-up.

**Target behavior**

- `/team-respond` remains only for `waiting` tasks.
- `/team-follow-up` or `api operation=follow-up-agent` is documented as continuation prompt.
- Error messages recommend the correct command.

**Suggested files**

- `src/extension/registration/commands.ts`
- `src/extension/help.ts`
- `docs/usage.md`
- `test/unit/registration-commands-coverage.test.ts`
- `test/unit/respond-tool.test.ts`

## P1 — Worker Lifecycle and Process Reliability

### P1.3 Two-phase child process teardown

**Current state**

Child workers have improved post-exit stdio guards and bounded drains, but cancellation semantics can be made more deterministic.

**Target behavior**

Worker process cancellation returns structured status:

```ts
interface WorkerExitStatus {
  exitCode: number | null;
  cancelled: boolean;
  timedOut: boolean;
  killed: boolean;
  signal?: string;
  cleanupErrors: string[];
  finalDrainMs: number;
}
```

Process lifecycle:

1. graceful cancel/TERM;
2. wait grace window;
3. hard kill process tree;
4. bounded stdout/stderr drain;
5. mark session non-reusable.

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/child-pi.ts`
- `src/runtime/pi-spawn.ts`
- `src/runtime/post-exit-stdio-guard.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-runner.ts`
- `src/runtime/cancellation.ts`
- `test/unit/child-pi*.test.ts`
- `test/integration/mock-child-run.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Cancelled worker always produces terminal task event.
- Output drains are bounded.
- Status includes `cancelled/timedOut/killed`.
- No zombie/stale running task after cancellation.

### P1.4 Reserve worker control channel before spawn

**Problem**

There can be a short window where a task is logically starting but cancel/steer cannot target a controller yet.

**Target behavior**

- Synchronously create a `WorkerRunCore`/controller before async spawn.
- Persist controller metadata in agent status.
- Cancel/steer requests can be queued immediately while startup is in progress.
- Controller is cleared in `finally`.

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/task-runner.ts`
- `src/runtime/agent-control.ts`
- `src/runtime/live-agent-control.ts`
- `src/runtime/crew-agent-records.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/api.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Starting worker can be cancelled immediately.
- Durable control request written during startup is applied or recorded as terminal no-op with reason.
- Tests simulate control request before child process emits first output.

## P1 — Cancellation and Attempt History

### P1.5 Add event-tree provenance: `parentEventId`, `attemptId`, `branchId`

**Current state**

Retry attempts have `attemptId`, and deadletters link to final attempt. Event log has sequence and terminal fingerprints but no general event tree.

**Target behavior**

- `TeamEvent.metadata` supports:

  ```ts
  parentEventId?: string;
  attemptId?: string;
  branchId?: string;
  causationId?: string;
  correlationId?: string;
  ```

- Retry events, task started/completed/failed, deadletter, recovery events link by `attemptId`.
- UI/status can show attempt timeline.

**Suggested files**

- `src/state/event-log.ts`
- `src/state/types.ts`
- `src/runtime/team-runner.ts`
- `src/runtime/retry-executor.ts`
- `src/runtime/recovery-recipes.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/status.ts`
- `test/unit/event-metadata.test.ts`
- `test/unit/retry-executor.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅

- ✅ Retry attempt events and terminal task events share attempt provenance.
- ✅ Deadletter records can be traced back to event sequence.
- ✅ Existing JSONL readers ignore missing provenance fields.
- ✅ `TeamEventMetadata` extended with `parentEventId`, `attemptId`, `branchId`, `causationId`, `correlationId`.

### P1.6 Synthetic terminal results for cancelled in-flight operations

**Problem**

Run/task cancellation events are now structured, but worker/tool sub-operations can still lack synthetic terminal records if cancelled mid-operation.

**Target behavior**

- If a task started a worker/tool/model call and cancellation occurs, append a synthetic terminal record:
  - `tool.cancelled` or `worker.cancelled`
  - reason code/message
  - startedAt/finishedAt
  - attemptId if available

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/task-runner.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-runner/progress.ts`
- `src/runtime/child-pi.ts`
- `src/runtime/cancellation.ts`
- `src/state/contracts.ts`
- `test/unit/cancellation.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅

- ✅ No started tool/model operation is left without terminal evidence after cancellation.
- ✅ Status/diagnostics can distinguish user cancel vs timeout vs shutdown.
- ✅ `buildSyntheticTerminalEvidence()` in `cancellation.ts` produces `"worker"`/`"cancelled"` records.

## P1 — Capability Inventory and Control Center

### P1.7 Build run/project capability inventory view

**Current state**

Per-task capability artifacts exist. There is no unified project/run inventory UI/API yet.

**Target behavior**

`/team-settings` or new `/team-control` shows normalized inventory:

```ts
interface CapabilityItem {
  id: string;
  kind: "team" | "workflow" | "agent" | "skill" | "tool" | "hook" | "runtime" | "provider";
  name: string;
  source: "builtin" | "project" | "user" | "runtime";
  path?: string;
  state: "active" | "disabled" | "shadowed" | "missing";
  disabledReason?: string;
  shadowedBy?: string;
}
```

**Suggested files**

- `src/extension/team-tool/handle-settings.ts`
- `src/extension/management.ts`
- `src/agents/discover-agents.ts`
- `src/teams/discover-teams.ts`
- `src/workflows/discover-workflows.ts`
- `src/runtime/skill-instructions.ts`
- `docs/resource-formats.md`
- `test/unit/management.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- ✅ Inventory is stable and sorted.
- ☐ Shadowed project/user/builtin resources are visible (not yet in capability inventory).
- ☐ Skill disabled/budget state is visible (not yet in capability inventory).
- ✅ No file path is used as the only stable ID (uses `kind:name` IDs).

### P1.8 Persist capability disables by stable ID

**Target behavior**

- Operator can disable a skill/agent/team by capability ID.
- Disable config survives path relocation when resource identity remains stable.
- Status explains disabled reason.

**Suggested files**

- `src/config/config.ts`
- `src/schema/config-schema.ts`
- discovery modules
- `test/unit/config-schema-validation.test.ts`

## P2 — Typed Hook Lifecycle

### P2.1 Introduce typed hook contract

**Target behavior**

Define typed lifecycle gates:

- `before_run_start`
- `before_task_start`
- `task_result`
- `before_cancel`
- `before_forget`
- `before_cleanup`
- `before_publish`
- `session_before_switch`
- `run_recovery`

Each hook declares:

```ts
type HookMode = "blocking" | "non_blocking";
type HookOutcome = "allow" | "block" | "modify" | "diagnostic";
```

Errors are recorded in diagnostics/events, not uncontrolled exceptions.

**Suggested files**

- new `src/hooks/*`
- `src/extension/register.ts`
- `src/runtime/team-runner.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/cancel.ts`
- `src/extension/team-tool/lifecycle-actions.ts`
- `docs/resource-formats.md`
- `test/unit/hooks*.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅ (partial — `before_cancel` not yet wired for async)

- ✅ Blocking hook can stop a run before worker start with clear event and status.
- ✅ Non-blocking hook failure records diagnostic and does not crash run.
- ✅ Hook context is redacted and bounded.
- ✅ `before_cancel` hook wired (async handleCancel conversion done).
- ✅ `before_forget` hook wired (async handleForget conversion done).
- ✅ `before_cleanup` hook wired (async handleCleanup conversion done).
- ✅ `task_result` hook wired in task-runner before completed/failed event.
- ✅ `before_publish` hook wired in handleExport.
- ☐ `session_before_switch` / `run_recovery` not yet wired (need more use cases).

### P2.2 Require intent via policy/hook for destructive actions

**Current state**

Intent is optional for cancel/cleanup/forget/prune.

**Target behavior**

- Optional config:

  ```json
  {
    "policy": {
      "requireIntentForDestructiveActions": true
    }
  }
  ```

- Actions requiring intent:
  - cancel
  - forget
  - prune
  - cleanup with force
  - publish/release helpers if added
  - worktree removal

**Acceptance criteria**

- Missing intent blocks action with actionable error.
- Existing tests can opt out or provide intent.
- Audit trail includes intent after approval.

## P2 — Durable History vs Prompt Projection

### P2.3 Separate durable run history projection from worker prompt text

**Current state**

Prompt pipeline artifacts exist, but context projection logic is still coupled to prompt construction in multiple places.

**Target behavior**

Introduce explicit projection functions:

```ts
transformRunContextBeforeWorkerStart(...)
convertRunHistoryToWorkerPrompt(...)
```

Rules:

- Durable history retains events, mailbox, artifacts, UI/runtime metadata.
- Worker prompt gets a bounded projection.
- UI/runtime events are not prompt text unless explicitly selected.

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/task-runner/prompt-pipeline.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-runner/prompt-builder.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-output-context.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-runner.ts`
- `test/unit/task-runner-prompt-pipeline.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Prompt pipeline artifact identifies every projection source.
- Large event/mailbox history is summarized or referenced, not blindly embedded.
- Tests verify UI/runtime events are not injected as instructions.

## P2 — Cooperative Cancellation for Internal Scans

### P2.4 Add internal `CancellationToken`

**Target behavior**

A utility for long internal loops:

```ts
interface CancellationToken {
  readonly aborted: boolean;
  readonly reason?: CancellationReason;
  heartbeat(stage?: string): void;
  throwIfCancelled(): void;
  wait(ms: number): Promise<void>;
}
```

Use it in:

- run index scans
- artifact cleanup
- mailbox validation/replay
- worktree cleanup
- diagnostic export
- large transcript/event reads

**Suggested files**

- new `src/runtime/cancellation-token.ts`
- `src/extension/run-index.ts`
- `src/extension/registration/artifact-cleanup.ts`
- `src/state/mailbox.ts`
- `src/ui/run-snapshot-cache.ts`
- `test/unit/cancellation-token.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria** ✅

- ✅ Long scan can abort within bounded cadence (`AbortSignal` wired into `collectRuns`, `validateMailbox`, `readAllMailboxMessages`, `pruneFinishedRuns`, `cleanupRunWorktrees`).
- ☐ `CancellationToken.heartbeat(stage)` not yet surfaced in diagnostics logs (signal-based early exit is wired; heartbeat is separate).
- ✅ Existing APIs can pass no token/signal and keep current behavior.

## P2 — Artifact Store Improvements

### P2.5 Content-addressed blob artifacts

**Target behavior**

Large logs/transcripts/results are stored as blobs:

```text
artifacts/blobs/sha256/<hash>
artifacts/blob-metadata/<hash>.json
```

Metadata includes:

- runId/taskId
- MIME/type
- producer
- original path/name
- size/hash
- redaction status
- retention policy

**Suggested files**

- `src/state/artifact-store.ts`
- `src/runtime/task-runner.ts`
- `src/ui/transcript-viewer.ts`
- `src/extension/run-export.ts`
- `src/extension/run-import.ts`
- `test/unit/artifact-store*.test.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Artifacts above threshold are blob-referenced.
- Run export/import preserves blobs.
- GC removes unreferenced blobs after retention.
- Path traversal protections remain intact.

## P2 — UI and Dashboard Upgrades

### P2.6 Show capability/effectiveness/cancellation panels in dashboard

**Target behavior**

Dashboard panes expose:

- run effectiveness score and no-observed-work tasks;
- cancellation reason and intent;
- capability inventory for selected task;
- attempt/deadletter timeline.

**Suggested files**

- `src/ui/run-dashboard.ts`
- `src/ui/dashboard-panes/*`
- `src/ui/snapshot-types.ts`
- `src/ui/run-snapshot-cache.ts`
- `test/unit/run-dashboard.test.ts`
- new pane tests

**Acceptance criteria**

- No heavy synchronous scans in render path.
- Pane output is width-safe.
- Snapshot cache provides precomputed compact data.

### P2.7 Event-first UI stream

**Target behavior**

Move more live UI updates from file polling to semantic events:

- `task_started`
- `task_completed`
- `worker_status`
- `mailbox_updated`
- `effectiveness_changed`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Render scheduler remains coalesced and overlap-safe.
- UI still recovers from durable files after restart.
- File polling is fallback, not the hot path.

## P2 — Raw Scan Entry Cache

### P2.8 Cache raw entries, not final semantic query results

**Target behavior**

Shared raw scan cache for:

- runs
- artifacts
- mailbox files
- transcript chunks
- worktree roots

Then apply filters/sorts after retrieval.

**Suggested files**

- `src/runtime/manifest-cache.ts`
- `src/ui/run-snapshot-cache.ts`
- `src/extension/run-index.ts`
- `src/utils/file-coalescer.ts`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Deterministic sort order.
- State mutation invalidates relevant raw entries.
- Large workspaces do not trigger full rescans on every render/status.

## P3 — Release/Install Hardening

### P3.1 Tarball install smoke before publish

**Target behavior**

Release workflow requires:

```bash
npm run ci
npm pack --dry-run
npm pack
# install tarball in temp project
# verify pi extension load smoke
# verify npm package files and version/tag consistency
```

**Suggested files**

- `docs/publishing.md`
- `package.json` scripts
- `.github/workflows/*` if CI is added
- optional `scripts/release-smoke.mjs`

**Acceptance criteria**

- Packed tarball loads extension in temp Pi home.
- Version in package, changelog, tag, npm view are consistent.
- Release instructions include rollback notes.

## Suggested Implementation Order

1. ~~**P0.1 Effectiveness policy enforcement**~~ ✅ Completed — default guard escalates `warn` to `blocked` for mutating-role tasks.
2. ~~**P0.2 Persist runtime safety**~~ ✅ Completed — manifests persist `runtimeResolution`; `runtime.resolved` event emitted.
3. **P1.3 Two-phase worker teardown** — reduces stale/zombie worker risk.
4. ~~**P1.1 Durable steering/follow-up queues**~~ ✅ Completed — `readMailbox` kind filter; API `read-mailbox` supports `config.kind`.
5. ~~**P1.5 Event-tree provenance**~~ ✅ Completed — `TeamEventMetadata` extended with `parentEventId`/`attemptId`/`branchId`/`causationId`/`correlationId`.
6. ~~**P1.7 Capability inventory view**~~ ✅ Completed — `buildCapabilityInventory()` + API `operation=inventory` + dashboard pane.
7. ~~**P2.3 Durable history projection**~~ ✅ Completed — `transformRunContextBeforeWorkerStart()` + `convertRunHistoryToWorkerPrompt()`.
8. ~~**P2.4 CancellationToken**~~ ✅ Completed — wired into `collectRuns`/`validateMailbox`/`pruneFinishedRuns`/`cleanupRunWorktrees` etc.
9. ~~**P2.5 Blob artifacts**~~ ✅ Completed — content-addressed blob store with SHA-256 dedup and metadata sidecars.
10. ~~**P2.6 Dashboard panels**~~ ✅ Completed — capability and cancellation panes.

Also completed (not in original order list):
- ~~**P1.6 Synthetic terminal results**~~ ✅ — `buildSyntheticTerminalEvidence()` for cancelled in-flight tasks.
- ~~**P2.1 Typed hook lifecycle**~~ ✅ — `before_run_start`/`before_task_start` wired into team-runner.

## Release Guidance

Before publishing a patch with these upgrades:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm pack --dry-run
```

For runtime/process changes also run targeted child-worker integration tests:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types --test --test-concurrency=1 --test-timeout=60000 \
