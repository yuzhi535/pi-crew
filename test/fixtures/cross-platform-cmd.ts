/**
 * cross-platform-cmd.ts — Cross-platform shell fixtures for unit tests.
 *
 * Many tests need to spawn a sub-command that:
 *   1. Always exits 0 (the "ok" command)
 *   2. Always exits non-zero (the "fail" command)
 *   3. Echoes a fixed string to stdout (the "echo" command)
 *
 * On POSIX (Linux/macOS), `echo ok` / `exit 1` / `echo '<msg>'` are
 * universal. On Windows, the host OS does not ship `/bin/echo` or `/bin/exit`
 * outside Git for Windows — and even with Git Bash, `execFileSync("echo", …)`
 * (used by the benchmark runner for security) cannot find `echo.exe` in the
 * PATH-preserved form Node uses.
 *
 * To stay portable without changing production code (e.g. loosening the
 * benchmark command allowlist), we substitute Node for those tests that
 * don't go through the benchmark allowlist. The Node-based form always
 * produces output identical to the POSIX form (including trailing newline),
 * so any assertion that compares stdout works on both platforms.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { pickCmd, OK_CMD, FAIL_CMD, ECHO_CMD } from "./cross-platform-cmd.ts";
 *   const cmd = pickCmd(OK_CMD);
 *   // → "echo ok" on POSIX,  "node -e \"process.stdout.write('ok\\n')\"" on win32
 *
 * Scope: TEST FIXTURES ONLY. Production code (`validateGateCommand`,
 * `validateCommand` in benchmark-runner) is intentionally NOT relaxed here.

 *   - POSIX: `sh -c "printenv <VAR>"` — built-in `printenv` writes the var.
 *   - Windows: `node -e "process.stdout.write(process.env.<VAR> || '')"`.
 *
 * The Windows variant is portable because the command string contains no
 * shell metacharacters that `validateGateCommand` would block (`$` would be
 * the only risk, and there is none inside the Node source string).
 *
 * NOTE: VAR must be a POSIX env-var identifier (ASCII letters, digits, underscore;
