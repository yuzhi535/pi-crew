/**
 * HB-001 integration: state-store durability under event pressure.
 *
 * Gap: the existing unit tests cover atomic-write and event-append in
 * isolation. This integration test covers the COMBINED path that HB-001
 * flagged — interleaved manifest writes + event appends to the same run's
 * state dir, then a full reload, asserting nothing is lost or corrupted.
 *
 * Uses the PRODUCTION createRunManifest API (not manual file writes) so the
 * run dir is laid out exactly as team-runner would, and loadRunManifestById
 * can find it across platforms (handles /var→/private/var on macOS and
 * path-canonicalisation on Windows).
