/**
 * Round 29 regression test — withFileLockSync re-entrance guard.
 *
 * Prior to this fix, withFileLockSync would self-deadlock when the same
 * call stack tried to acquire the same file lock twice (e.g.
 * registerWorker -> cleanupOrphanWorkers -> readRegistry on the same
 * registry file). The second acquisition would read its own freshly-
 * written lock file (same pid, fresh createdAt), fail the steal
 * check, and retry for the full staleMs window — hanging the file.
 *
 * See research-findings/round-29-file-level-test-hangs.md for the full
 * mechanism + strace evidence.
