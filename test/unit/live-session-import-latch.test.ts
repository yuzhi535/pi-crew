/**
 * Module-scoped import latch for the live-session peer dependency.
 *
 * Root cause of the 2026-06-16 subagent-cold-start failures:
 * When N in-process live-session subagents spawn CONCURRENTLY (e.g. several
 * `Agent({ run_in_background: true })` calls issued in one turn), each used to
 * call `await import("@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent")` independently. Under
 * the tsx loader (which registers `load`/`resolve` hooks), concurrent
 * first-imports can each enter the loader and race module-record
 * instantiation. The result is a namespace binding observed mid-evaluation as
 * `undefined`:
 *   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'existsSync')`
 *   - `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'validateWorkflowForTeam')`
 *
 * Observed during the 4-repo UI/UX research deep-dive: 4 explorer subagents
 * launched together (`pi-sub`, `pi-bar`, `pi-status`, `pi-powerline-footer`);
 * 3 of 4 crashed with the above errors. All 3 succeeded on SEQUENTIAL retry,
 * which confirms a cold-start race rather than a logic bug (same code, same
 * args, same repo — only the concurrency changed).
 *
 * ESM engines memoize dynamic imports, but that memoization is not guaranteed
 * to be observed synchronously across concurrent evaluation under transpiling
 * loaders, so we add an explicit JS-level latch: the FIRST caller sets the
 * module-scoped promise; every later caller awaits the same in-flight promise.
 * This guarantees a single module-record instantiation regardless of loader
 * behavior.
 *
 * Tests below guard the latch (presence + that the old un-memoized call site
 * is gone) so it can't regress.
