/**
 * L1 — RunEventBus.onWithReplay tests.
 *
 * Validates the catch-up-replay primitive that closes the
 * transient-subscriber-absence gap: when an overlay/widget is disposed and
 * recreated, events emitted in the window are replayed from the durable
 * JSONL log before the live listener attaches, with seq-based dedup so each
 * event fires exactly once.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   - replay order and completeness (events missed during absence)
 *   - dedup: a live event whose seq was already replayed is suppressed
 *   - transient live-only events (no seq) always deliver
 *   - cursor bound: large log does not OOM (limit honored)
 *   - missing/nonexistent log → graceful live-only fallback
 *   - unsubscribe detaches the live listener
