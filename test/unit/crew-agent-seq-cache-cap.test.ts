/**
 * Round 22 (defensive caps): The `agentEventSeqCache` Map is module-level
 * (singleton) and used to memoize the `.seq` value per event-log filePath.
 * Without a cap, a long-running pi-crew process that spawns 1000s of agents
 * accumulates 1000s of cache entries.
 *
 * The cap is enforced inside a private helper function
 * `setAgentEventSeqCache()` that the public `appendCrewAgentEvent()` goes
 * through on every call. This test exercises the cap by calling
 * `appendCrewAgentEvent` 1001 times with distinct taskIds, which forces the
 * cap to trigger at least once.
 *
 * Note: this test takes ~1-2 seconds because it creates 1001 event files
 * in a temp directory. That's the cost of fully exercising the eviction
 * path through the public API.
