 * B1 regression: `team action=cleanup dryRun=true` (a PREVIEW that writes
 * nothing) used to be blocked by the tool_call gate with "requires confirm=true",
 * forcing users to pass confirm=true just to preview. dryRun should always be
 * allowed. These tests pin the gate logic (extracted into a pure function for
 * testability — the live handler in register.ts delegates here).
