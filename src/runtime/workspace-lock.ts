/**
 * workspace-lock.ts — Per-cwd workspace lock with startTime-safe liveness (P1g).
 *
 * RFC: research-findings/goal-workflow/13-VISION-RFC.md v0.5 §P1g + D10.
 *
 * Closes #8 (multi-goal clobber) and the B-2 PID-recycling gap. Each
 * `workspaceMode:"single"` goal acquires this lock for its entire lifetime,
 * serializing concurrent goals that share a cwd.
 *
 * Lockfile location: `<crewRoot>/state/workspace-locks/<sha256(absCwd)>.lock`
 * Lockfile contents: { pid, startTime, heartbeat, goalId, acquiredAt }
 *
 * ─── LIVENESS = stale-reconciler startTime pattern (D10, B-2 fix) ───
 * A lock is STALE iff EITHER:
 *   (a) the recorded pid's CURRENT startTime ≠ the lockfile startTime
 *       (the PID was recycled to a different process), OR
 *   (b) the heartbeat is older than HEARTBEAT_STALE_MS (default 60s)
 *       (the process crashed without exiting / heartbeat stopped).
 *
 * Why NOT child-pi.ts killProcessPid (B-2): killProcessPid uses
 * process.kill(pid, 0) which is PID-only — vulnerable to PID recycling. The
 * startTime + before/after re-verify pattern is TOCTOU-correct.
 *
 * getProcessStartTime is NOT exported from stale-reconciler.ts, so its logic
 * is REPLICATED here (RFC §P1g explicitly permits importing OR replicating).
 * The replication matches stale-reconciler.ts:112 field-for-field.
 *
 * Granularity: per-goal, held for the goal's lifetime (release() on goal end).
 * Contention: default QUEUE (poll until released or stale);
 *             opts.failOnWorkspaceBusy:true → THROW instead of queue.
