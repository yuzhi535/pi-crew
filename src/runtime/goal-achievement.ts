/**
 * #2 (assessment): goal-achievement detection — kills the "false-green" lie.
 *
 * The v0.9.13 assessment found run team_20260626170635 reported terminal-success
 * ("completed") while its verifier wrote: "did NOT apply ANY of the three
 * security fixes. git diff --stat for all 6 target files is empty… Tests are
 * green only because nothing was changed." The run status LIED.
 *
 * This module assesses whether a completed run actually achieved its goal, so
 * the false-green is no longer SILENT. It is deliberately conservative:
 *   - read-only / doc-only workflows are never accused (they legitimately make
 *     no project-code edits; their outputs land in gitignored .crew/),
 *   - a false-green is only flagged for CODE-MUTATING runs (executor /
 *     test-engineer steps) in a git repo whose working tree is empty,
 *   - status is downgraded to "failed" ONLY when a corroborating signal (a
 *     task that actually failed) confirms it; otherwise the suspicion is
 *     exposed via `goalAchieved=false` + a prominent event + manifest note,
 *     without breaking a legitimately-no-op run.
