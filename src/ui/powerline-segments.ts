/**
 * Powerline-style segment rendering.
 *
 * Ported from pi-bar's `renderSegment` technique (see
 * `research-findings/pi-ecosystem-distillation.md` T3): the cleanest filled-bg
 * color-handoff pattern. A powerline segment is a run of background color with
 * foreground text, where adjacent segments visually chain via a separator glyph
 * whose FG is the NEXT segment's BG (creating the smooth arrow/slash transition).
 *
 * The canonical 10-step sequence for ONE segment (bg=A.bg, fg=A.fg):
 *
 *     fg(A.bg) + leading-sep + RESET + bg(A.bg) + fg(A.fg) + text + RESET
 *           + fg(A.bg) + trailing-sep + RESET
 *
 * The leading separator's foreground is THIS segment's bg; the trailing
 * separator's foreground is the NEXT segment's bg. With RESET between every
 * phase, no SGR state leaks across segments — critical because mixed bold/fg/bg
 * across adjacent runs is the #1 source of color bleed in terminal output.
 *
 * `bg?` is OPTIONAL on CrewTheme (some themes can't fill backgrounds), so when
 * `bg` is unavailable we gracefully degrade to a fg-only segment with a plain
 * separator (no powerline arrow), so the widget stays readable everywhere.
