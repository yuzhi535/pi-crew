/**
 * Permission gate logic for destructive team actions (delete/forget/prune/cleanup).
 *
 * Extracted from register.ts `pi.on("tool_call")` handler into a pure function
 * so the gate logic is unit-testable in isolation (the handler itself is hard
 * to test because it's an async event listener on the Pi extension API).
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when the action is ALLOWED, or a block `reason` string
 * when it should be blocked. The handler wraps this and emits the `{block, reason}`
 * shape Pi expects.
 *
 * Rules (in order):
 *  1. Non-team / non-destructive actions → allowed (caller pre-filters, but safe).
 *  2. `cleanup` with `dryRun=true` → ALWAYS allowed (a preview writes nothing,
 *     so gating it would block users from previewing what cleanup would do —
 *     this was a UX bug: team action=cleanup dryRun=true returned "requires
 *     confirm=true" even though it changed no files).
 *  3. `confirm=true` on the input → allowed (explicit user intent).
 *  4. `delete` with `force=true` → allowed (force bypasses reference checks).
 *  5. Otherwise → blocked with a reason telling the user what to pass.
