/**
 * action-suggestions.ts — "Did you mean?" suggestions for team actions (DX: F1).
 *
 * Round 16 DX audit found that a typo'd action (`action: 'stat'`,
 * `action: 'summery'`) hits a dead-end "Unknown action: stat" with no path
 * forward. pi-crew already ships a Levenshtein fuzzy-matcher
 * (`src/config/suggestions.ts → suggestConfigKey`); this module applies it to
 * the known set of team actions.
 *
 * The known-action list mirrors the `action` enum in
 * `src/schema/team-tool-schema.ts`. Kept as a hand-maintained constant (not
 * derived from the TypeBox schema at runtime) so it is trivially testable and
 * avoids pulling the schema into low-level error paths.
