 * Filesystem watcher helpers (slimmed down — pts/2 hang fix 2026-06-16).
 *
 * The recursive-watcher helpers (createRecursiveWatcher / watchCrewState /
 * runIdFromStateRelativePath) were REMOVED: a recursive fs.watch on the run
 * state tree exploded to O(total run history) inotify watches on Linux and
 * caused a permanent interactive-session busy-loop. The bounded
 * {@link RunWatcherRegistry} (one non-recursive watcher per ACTIVE run) now
 * replaces them. Only the two primitives below survive — they are still used by
 * manifest-cache, result-watcher, and run-watcher-registry.
